There's a crossroads.

If you go left, go to _$LEFT
If you go right, go to _$RIGHT

_:LEFT
There's a dude.

He says "sup, bro".

_#You may rob dude [go to _$FIGHT], beg from dude [go to _$BEG], or simply ignore
_#him and move on.

_# these are each tables:
_# rob
_# beg
_# task about illuminati
_# task about Sue Anne
_# intimidate
_# 
_# items in each row are obfuscated into numbers
_# rob table:
_# aslkdj
_# asdlk
_# dude -> $FIGHT
_# alkjsdl
_# 
_# this would mean that I have a large set of operations (rob, beg, talk about,
_# ...) that I have to know about and try for every entity (e.g. dude)
_# 
_# starting to feel like a computer game?
